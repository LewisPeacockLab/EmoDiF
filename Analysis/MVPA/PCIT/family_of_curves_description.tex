\begin{itemize}

\item The {\em dip} in a theory-consistent curve is a point that is
  located horizontally between the left edge of the curve and the
  rise. Within this horizontal range, the dip is the lowest point on
  the curve; it also has to fall below zero on the y-axis.

\item The {\em rise} in a theory-consistent curve is a point that is
  located horizontally to the right of the dip. Within this horizontal
  range, the rise is the highest point on the curve; it also has to
  fall above zero on the y-axis.

\end{itemize}


Branch I: y2 defines the dip and y3 defines the rise.
\begin{enumerate}
\item -1 $\leq$ y2 $<$ 0, y2 is the dip so it must fall below zero
\item 0 $<$ y3 $\leq$ 1, y3 is the rise so it must fall above zero
\item -1 $\leq$ y4 $\leq$ y3, y4 can hold any value that is below the
  rise (y3)
\item y2 $<$ y1 $\leq$ 1, y1 can hold any value that is above the dip
  (y2)
\end{enumerate}


Branch II: y2 defines the dip and y4 defines the rise
\begin{enumerate}
\item -1 $\leq$ y2 $<$ 0, y2 is the dip so it must fall below zero
\item 0 $<$ y4 $\leq$ 1, y4 is the rise so it must fall above zero
\item y2 $\leq$ y3 $\leq$ y4, y3 can hold any value between the dip
  and the rise
\item y2 $<$ y1 $\leq$ 1, y1 can hold any value that is above the dip (y2)
\end{enumerate}

Branch III: y3 defines the dip and y4 defines the rise
\begin{enumerate}
\item -1 $\leq$ y3 $<$ 0, y3 is the dip so it must fall below zero
\item 0 $<$ y4 $\leq$ 1, y4 is the rise so it must fall above zero
\item y3 $<$ y1 $\leq$ 1, y1 can hold any value that is above the dip
\item y3 $\leq$ y2 $\leq$ 1, y2 can hold any value that is above the
  dip
\end{enumerate}
